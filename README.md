## Overview

Snakes is a web-based implementation of the classic Snake game, built using React and Vite. In this game, players control a snake to consume food items, causing the snake to grow in length. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score without colliding with the snake's own body. Note: Walls do not exist here...
